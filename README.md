## Overview

The Smart Dynamic Parking Price Optimization System is designed to adjust parking fees in real-time. By analyzing demand, traffic, and competition, the system employs adaptive pricing models to enhance parking utilization and reduce congestion. Users can visualize the pricing strategies through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, allowing them to simulate dynamic pricing scenarios effectively.

## Features

- **Real-time Pricing**: Adjusts fees based on current demand and traffic conditions.
- **Adaptive Models**: Uses machine learning algorithms to optimize pricing.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes data and pricing strategies using Streamlit.
- **Rerouting Logic**: Suggests alternative parking options to reduce congestion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation and easy-to-understand data visualization.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a variety of technologies to ensure effective performance and user experience:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive dashboard.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Bokeh**: For interactive plots and dashboards.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Various algorithms for predictive modeling.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishek999999-creator/IIT-Guhawati-Final-Capstone-Project.git
   cd IIT-Guhawati-Final-Capstone-Project
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Releases**:
   You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/abhishek999999-creator/IIT-Guhawati-Final-Capstone-Project/releases) and execute the necessary files.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the Streamlit app to access the dashboard. Use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the dashboard.

## Interactive Dashboard

The interactive dashboard serves as the central hub for users to explore the dynamic pricing system. It features:

- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Displays current parking availability and pricing.
- **Simulation Tools**: Allows users to simulate different scenarios by adjusting parameters.
- **User Feedback**: Users can provide input on their experience, which can help improve the system.

## How It Works

The system operates on a set of algorithms that analyze various data points:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers data on current parking availability, traffic conditions, and competitor pricing.
2. **Demand Forecasting**: Uses machine learning models to predict future demand based on historical data.
3. **Price Adjustment**: Adjusts parking fees dynamically based on predicted demand and competition.
4. **User Interaction**: The dashboard allows users to visualize these changes and understand pricing strategies.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

The project employs several machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression**: For predicting parking demand based on historical trends.
- **Decision Trees**: To analyze and classify data for better pricing strategies.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: For grouping similar parking zones and optimizing pricing based on location.

### Data Normalization

Data normalization is crucial for ensuring that all input features contribute equally to the model's predictions. The project uses various techniques to standardize data, improving the accuracy of machine learning algorithms.
